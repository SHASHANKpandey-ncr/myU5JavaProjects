Q3.Explain upper bounded wildcards and lower bounded wildcards 
   with an example.
   
   Ans -
   
   Upper Bound WildCards --
   
   Its use is to decrease the restrictions on a variable.
   It restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a sub-type.
   It is used with "?" followed by the extends/implements keyword.
   It basically provides sub-type access.
   
   Ex.
   
    List<? extends Number> 
    
    The above example conveys that List can be of any type which is 
    sub-type of number. Like List<Integer> or  List<double> etc.
    
    
    
   Lower Bound WildCards --
   
   Its use is to decrease the restrictions on a variable.
   It restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a Super-type.
   It is used with "?" followed by the super keyword.
   It basically provides Super-type access.
   
   Ex.
   
    List<? super Integer> 
    
    The above example conveys that List can be of any type which is 
    Super-type of number. Like List<Number>.
