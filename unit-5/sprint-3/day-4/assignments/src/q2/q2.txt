q2.A. What is normalization and why is it needed?
Ans. Normalization is a process of organizing the data in database to avoid data
	 redundancy, insertion anomaly, update anomaly & deletion anomaly. 
	 
	 The purpose of normalization is to maximize the efficiency of a database.
	 
q2.B. Explain the difference between an insert anomaly, update anomaly and delete anomaly.
Ans.  
		Employee Table:
              emp_id   emp_name   emp_address   emp_dept
              101        Rick        Delhi         D001
              101        Rick        Delhi         D002
              123 	 Maggie      Agra 	   D890
              166        Glenn       Chennai       D900
              166        Glenn       Chennai       D004
              
              
The above table is not normalized. We will monitor the problems that we face when a table
is not normalized.

Update anomaly:
 In the above table we have two rows for employee Rick as he
belongs to two departments of the company. If we want to update the address of Rick
then we have to update the same in two rows or the data will become inconsistent. If
somehow, the correct address gets updated in one department but not in another then
as per the database, Rick would be having two different addresses, which is not correct
and would lead to inconsistent data.

Insert anomaly: 
Suppose a new employee joins the company, who is under training
and currently not assigned to any department then we would not be able to insert the
data into the table if emp_dept field doesnâ€™t allow nulls.

Delete anomaly: 
Suppose, if at a point of time the company closes the department
D890 then deleting the rows that are having emp_dept as D890 would also delete the
information of employee Maggie since she is assigned only to this department.
To overcome these anomalies we need to normalize the data.
