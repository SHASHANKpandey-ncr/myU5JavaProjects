Q. Explain different types of Normalisation forms in a DBMS with an Example Table.

Ans. Types of normalization forms are as follows:

1. First normal from (1NF)
2. Second normal from (2NF)

Before having a look at normalized form first let us have a look at a form which is NOT normalized:


StudentId  		Name 		Aadhar 			BikeNo 		visitingNo
			
01				Aman		0123			delhi01			01
											delhi02			02											
02				Arjun		0145			delhi05			05
											delhi04			04
	
	
In above table one attribute/column is containing more that one entries/data hence it is known as 
a non-normalized form.

If we convert above table such that no repeating groups or data is present in any attribute/column 
than it will be knon as 1NF :	

StudentId  		Name 		Aadhar 			BikeNo 		visitingNo
			
01				Aman		0123			delhi01			01
01				Aman		0123			delhi02			02												
02				Arjun		0145			delhi05			05
02				Arjun		0145			delhi04			04	


and if we convert above table such that all the prime attribute are independent of subsets of cadidate
keys than it will be known as a 2NF:



Student table : 

StudentId  		Name 		Aadhar 
			
01				Aman		0123
02				Arjun		0145




Bike table:

 BikeNo 	visitingNo
			
delhi01			01
delhi02			02												
delhi05			05
delhi04			04	



StudentBike table :

StudentBikeId       studentId       BikeNo
1						01			delhi01
2						01			delhi02
3						02			delhi05
4      					02			delhi04
