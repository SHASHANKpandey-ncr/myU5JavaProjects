2A) Explain ThreadPool Executor in java with an Example.
Ans.
     Use of ThreadPool executor in Java is to improve the use of different threads.
     
     It helps in creating a pool of threads and to execute them.
     
     We can use ThreadPool Executor to choose any number of Thread Executors and it helps to
     execute the available threads in a optimum and sequential manner and also helps to reduce 
     the overall execution time.
     
     All the APIs related to ThreadPool Executor can be found in java.util.concurrent package.
     
     
     
     For example please refer to class Q2_A_example in package q2.A(in the same package).
