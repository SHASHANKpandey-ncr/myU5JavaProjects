Q2) Explain the Thread Life Cycle in Java with your
own words.

Ans. We can describe the Life cycle of a thread in java by the states in 
	 which a thread exists. 
	 
	 In Java, a thread always exists in one of the following states :-
	 
	 1)  New state - It refers to the state when a new thread is just 
	 				 created. The following statement can be referred as 
	 				 New state of a thread : 
	 				 
	 				 Thread newThread= new Thread();
	 				 
	 				 
	 2)  Runnable state - It refers to the state when a new thread is just 
	 				 	  started. The following statement can be referred as 
	 				  	  New state of a thread : 
	 				 
	 				      newThread.start(); 
	 				      
	 				   
	 3)  Running state -  This is the state where the thread scheduler selects a thread
	 					  and the thread is executed.	
	 					  
	 					  
	 4)  Blocked state -  This is the state where the thread scheduler halts or blocks or pause 
	 					  the thread.
	 					  
	 					  		 					  			      
	 5)  Dead state -  This is the state where the thread is completely executed.
